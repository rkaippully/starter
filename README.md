# What is starter?
Server side software development usually needs frequent restarts. You would launch a server, make
code changes, recompile the code, and then restart the server. Starter attempts to automate this
tedious cycle.

See documentation of module `Starter` for details.

An example web server using starter can be found in `example` directory.
